# Unit 1 Programming Project #
## Goal: ##
_Create a Java program using Unit 1 topics to demonstrate knowledge and mastery._

You may work in groups of up to 3, note the requirements change slightly (see rubric below).
## Requirements/Rubric: ##
1. Tie it to a real-world topic. Create a `README.md` ([markdown cheatsheet here](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)) file with an explanation of your real-world topic:
	- Should be linked to an article, podcast, video, etc. with a social justice theme ***OR*** 
	- A personal idea for something that is useful/fun for you, your community, etc.
2. Must use materials from, **and restricted to**, topics we've covered so far:
	- data/typecasting
	- basic and formatted output
	- static methods and parameters
3. Your project must specifically have:
	- At least 5 data variables, and use of `String`, `int`, and `double`
	- At least 2 distinct static method definitions *per group member* used in your program in a useful way (make sure to `//comment` which group member created each method)
	- A demonstration of some sort of calculation or transformation of data
	- Formatted output used in a meaningful way to the real-world topic

## Resources: ##
- OLI Modules + Lecture Videos - for examples, Java syntax rules, and strategy
- Replit Labs - larger examples, getting inspiration for ideas

## Strategy: ##
- Choose something you are interested in, not only does that help with motivation but it'll help you think of how to apply this units topics and the requirements above in useful ways
- Ask for help often, the earlier you get started the more time you have to ask your instructor/tutors for guidance
- *Dream big, build small*. We won't be able to build what we dream up right now, but what is a part of the big idea you have that you *can* build? This could be the start of not only your CS111 final project, but maybe future research, business venture, etc.!

## Scoring Guide (EARN Scale): ##
All group members might not recieve the same score. Be sure to indicate which parts of the project you contributed. You may also be asked to explain portions of the code so that I can distinguish your personal understanding of the material.

- **Exemplary** (***E***): Everything for A, plus code is well-documented and follows all course style conventions. This work could be used as a classroom example.
- **Acceptable** (***A***): Understanding of the concepts is evident. Code compiles and runs without errors. All of the requirements are met.
- **Revision Needed** (***R***): Partial understanding of the concepts is evident, but there are significant gaps. Further review and improvements required. Program does not run or not all requirements are met. 
- **Not Assessable** (***N***): Not enough information is present in the work to determine whether there is understanding of the concepts.
